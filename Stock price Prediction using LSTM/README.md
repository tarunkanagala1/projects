#Project Overview

This a General Stock Price Prediction using LSTM's(Long Short Term Memory) model.
In this Project we'll predict the price of Microsoft stock

These types of models are RNN( Recurrent Neural Networks) which are mainly  used for Sequence Prediction Models.

For reference I had used Microsoft stock but it is mostly similar for any other stocks which you like.




## Installation



```bash
  pip install pandas
  python -m pip install -U pip
  python -m pip install -U matplotlib  
  pip install tensorflow
```
    
## Further Extension

This model used dataset which only has Frequency of 'Daily' , however if extended with a better provider which gives more frequent updates on the stock with every tick or 1 min,5mins,15mins,30mins,1hr,2hrs.5hrs,1day,2days,1week,1month,1year,YTD. The model may predict with more accuracy.
